# Project coding standards for TypeScript

Apply the [general coding guidelines](./.instructions.md) to all code.

## JavaScript Guidelines
- Follow functional programming principles where possible
- Use ES module syntax (`import`/`export`)
- Use async/await for asynchronous logic
- Prefer immutable data (const, readonly)
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators
- Prefer named exports for utility functions

## React Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the React hooks rules (no conditional hooks)
- Keep components small and focused
